> [!NOTE] Coach's Note
> We are attacking the "Right-Side Leak." Your data indicates that while your bilateral force (Trap Bar) is high, your unilateral stability is "glass". This week, the **Tempo** is your metric of success. If you cannot hold the **3s Isometric**, the weight is too heavy for your current neural state.

---

## 🏋🏿 Day 1: PUSH & LATERAL STABILITY 
**Focus:** Solving the "Left-Side Trunk Leak" to stabilize the right-side drive.

> [!abstract] Mind-Body Connection 
> **The Pillar:** On the Landmine Press, do not allow your torso to rotate. Your core must be an iron rod. If the trunk moves, force is being "leaked" rather than transferred to the ball.


| Exercise | Sets | Target | Tempo | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Max/Start Rec. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neutral DB Bench** | 4 | 6 | 2-1-X-0 | | | | | **70 lbs** |
| **Copenhagen Plank** | 4 | 30s/side | ISO | | | | | **New: BW** |
| **1-Arm Landmine Press**| 3 | 8/side | 1-0-X-1 | | | | | **100 lbs** |
| **Pallof Press Hold** | 3 | 15s/side | ISO | | | | | **Med Tension**|
| **Plyo Push-up** | 3 | 8 | 0-1-X-0 | | | | | **12 reps** |
| **Face Pulls** | 3 | 15 | 1-0-1-3 | | | | | **55 lbs** |

**Notes**:
- Trunk Rigidness (1-5): Did you keep the "Pillar" locked during 1-Arm Landmine Presses? (1 = Leaking/Rotating, 5 = Iron Rod).
- Copenhagen Difficulty (1-5): Rate the adductor strain on your right side.
- Hardware Check: Any "clicking" in the anterior shoulder during DB Bench? (Y/N)

**Nightly Recovery:**
- **Scapular Wall Slides:** 2 x 12
- **Barefoot Arch Doming:** 3 x 15 (Focus on "short foot" to wake up the nerves).

---

## 🏋🏿 Day 2: LOWER (Eccentric Braking)
**Focus:** Converting the "loose" ankle into a rigid lever.

> [!abstract] Mind-Body Connection 
> **The Brake:** On the Heiden Stick, land on the ball of your foot and "freeze" instantly. No wobbling. If you wobble, the rep doesn't count. We are training the brain to find stability in chaos.

| Exercise                 | Sets | Target   | Tempo   | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Max/Start Rec.      |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :------- | :------ | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :------------------ |
| **Trap Bar Deadlift**    | 4    | 3        | 1-0-X-0 |       |       |       |       | **315 lbs**         |
| **Box Jumps**            | 4    | 3        | 0-0-X-0 |       |       |       |       | **36 in**           |
| **RFE Split Squat**      | 3    | 5/side   | 1-3-X-0 |       |       |       |       | **65 lbs**          |
| **Lateral Heiden Stick** | 3    | 5/side   | 0-0-X-3 |       |       |       |       | **New: 10lb DB**    |
| **Iso-Soleus Wall Push** | 3    | 45s/side | ISO     |       |       |       |       | **New: 70% Intent** |
| **Seated Calf Raise**    | 3    | 12       | 2-1-1-2 |       |       |       |       | **90 lbs**          |

**Notes**:
- The "Freeze" (1-5): On Heiden Sticks, did the right ankle land "dead" or did it wobble? (1 = Wobble, 5 = Frozen).
- Hold Compliance: Did you cheat the 3-second isometric on the RFE Split Squats? (Y/N)
- Soleus Intent (1-5): Rate your maximum force output on the Wall Push.

**Nightly Recovery (Day 2):**
- **Ankle Distraction Stretch:** 2 x 60s
- **Couch Stretch:** 2 x 90s/side

---
## 🏋🏿 Day 3: ACTIVE RECOVERY / NEURAL REWIRING
**Focus:** Barefoot proprioception. No lifting.

- **Barefoot Single-Leg Balance (Eyes Closed):** 4 x 30s/side.
- **Tibialis Anterior Stretch:** 3 x 60s.
- **90/90 Hip Flow:** 5 minutes continuous.

**Notes**:
- Proprioceptive Drift (1-5): How much "sway" did you feel during eyes-closed balance on the right vs. left?
- Tissue Tension (1-5): How "tight" did the 90/90 Hip Flow feel compared to last week?

---

## 🏋🏿 Day 4: PULL & POSTERIOR CHAIN
**Focus:** Forcing the Right Leg to match the Left Leg's capacity.

> [!abstract] Mind-Body Connection 
> **The Anchor:** On the SL-RDL, keep the right hip "closed" (pointing toward the floor). Do not let it flare open. This forces the glute medius and ankle stabilizers to work together.

| Exercise                | Sets | Target | Tempo   | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Max/Start Rec.     |
| :---------------------- | :--- | :----- | :------ | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :----------------- |
| **Weighted Pull-Ups**   | 4    | 5      | 1-0-1-1 |       |       |       |       | **Max: Chain**     |
| **Dead Hangs**          | 3    | Max    | ISO     |       |       |       |       | **70 sec**         |
| **SL-RDL (Right Side)** | 4    | 10     | 3-1-X-0 |       |       |       |       | **30 lbs** (Start) |
| **SL-RDL (Left Side)**  | 3    | 10     | 3-1-X-0 |       |       |       |       | **45 lbs**         |
| **Chest-Supported Row** | 3    | 10     | 1-1-1-1 |       |       |       |       | **59 lbs**         |
| **DB Pullover**         | 3    | 12     | 2-0-1-0 |       |       |       |       | **70 lbs**         |

**Coach's Note:** You will perform 4 sets of SL-RDL on the **Right** and only 3 sets on the **Left**. We must overload the weak link to close the gap.

**Notes:**
- Imbalance RPE: Was the Right Side SL-RDL (Set 4) harder than the Left Side (Set 3)? [Y/N]
- Hip Orientation (1-5): Were you able to keep the right hip "closed" (pointing down) during the RDL?
- Grip Status (1-5): Rate your thumbless hang endurance vs. your 70s max.

## 🏋🏿 Day 5: UPPER BODY VELOCITY
**Focus:** Rate of Force Development (RFD) and trunk snap.

| Exercise | Sets | Target | Tempo | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Max/Start Rec. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MB Chest Throw** | 4 | 5 | X-X-X-X | | | | | **25 lbs** |
| **Hanging Knee Raises**| 3 | 15 | 1-0-1-2 | | | | | **Max: BW** |
| **Shoulder Press** | 3 | 6 | 1-0-X-1 | | | | | **115 lbs** |
| **Speed Machine Row** | 3 | 10 | 0-0-X-0 | | | | | **250 kcal**|
| **DB Lateral Raise** | 3 | 15 | 1-0-1-1 | | | | | **22.5 lbs**|

**Nightly Recovery (Day 5):**
- **Cat-Cow:** 20 reps slow.
- **Side-Lying External Rotation:** 2 x 15/side.

**Notes:**
- Neural Snap (1-5): Did the Med Ball throws feel "electric" (fast) or "heavy" (grinding)?
- VBT Feel: Did you maintain bar speed on the Shoulder Press, or did it slow down on the final reps?
- Core Recruitment: Did you feel your lats "snap" the weight during the Speed Row? (Y/N)

## 🧘🏿 Day 6: REACTIVE (Max Displacement)
**Focus:** Testing the "Spring" and ankle stiffness under high-velocity conditions.

> [!abstract] Mind-Body Connection 
> **The Spring:** On Pogo Jumps, keep the knees nearly locked. The bounce comes entirely from the ankle. Minimize ground contact time—"The floor is lava."

| Exercise | Sets | Metric | Tempo | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Max/Start Rec. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuous Pogos** | 3 | 30s | X-0-X-0 | | | | | **Max Rhythm**|
| **Iso-Tibialis Hold** | 3 | 45s | ISO | | | | | **Max Effort**|
| **Depth Vertical Jump**| 4 | 3 reps | 0-0-X-0 | | | | | **48 in Drop**|
| **Approach Jump** | 5 | Max | 0-0-X-0 | | | | | **48 in Max** |
| **SL-Lateral Bound** | 4 | 4/side | 0-0-X-3 | | | | | **Focus: Right**|

**Notes**:
- Spring Quality (1-5): On Pogo Jumps, did the floor feel like "Lava" (stiff) or "Mud" (soft)?
- Amortization Speed (1-5): On Depth Jumps, was the time between landing and takeoff minimal?
- Ankle Security: Did the right ankle feel "loose" during approach jumps? (Y/N)

**Nightly Recovery (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **Barefoot SL-Balance (Eyes Closed):** 4 x 30s/side (Rewiring mechanoreceptors).
2. **Short-Foot Arch Doming:** 3 x 15 (Building foot-floor "rooting").
3. **Couch Stretch:** 2 x 90s/side (Opening hip flexors for better vertical extension).

**Constraint:** 60 Minutes Max.

- **Warmup:** Barefoot jogging on sideline (5 min).
- **Skill:** Form Shooting / 1-Dribble Pull-ups.
- **Game Play:** Low-intensity situational work. Focus on **Lateral Stops**. If the right ankle feels "loose," shut it down.

**Notes:**
- Lateral Stop Integrity (1-5): Rate your confidence in the right ankle during hard stops/change of direction.
- Ankle "Memory": Did you notice the "funny" roll sensation at any point during skill work? (Y/N)
- Systemic Fatigue: Do you feel ready for Monday's high-load Push session? (Y/N)

**Nightly Recovery:**
- **Pigeon Stretch:** 2 x 60s/side.
- **Foam Roll Calves/IT Band:** 5 minutes.
